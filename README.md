# Flavour Terminal files for Gradient Decent 
Some flavour messages/log-files for the [Gradient Descent](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/collections/mothership-modules/products/gradient-descent) module of the sci-fi horror TTRPG Mothership. When I first read the module, I was a bit disappointed that there are no jumping-off points for what the players can find in the terminals. I understand this is partly intentional so that Keepers can improvise and decide what is best for the situation, but it still bugged me. Later, I got the idea of emulating certain terminals by letting my players navigate a directory on my Linux laptop thrue the shell. I paired that with the [cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term) terminal for some more visual flavor (also available on [windows](https://gist.github.com/h3r/2d5dcb2f64cf34b6f7fdad85c57c1a45) over wsl). Depending on how comfortable your players are with terminals you should tell them the important commands for navigation (cd <dir-name>, cd .., ls/dir) and for displaying text files (cat/type).

I will be adding more terminals, logs, and chat entries as time goes on, according to the progress my group makes with the module. Please feel free to contribute your own terminals, logs, users, chats, etc.
