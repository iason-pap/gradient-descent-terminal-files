# Flavour Terminal files for Gradient Decent 
Some flavour messages/log-files to aid enviromental storytelling in [Gradient Descent](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/collections/mothership-modules/products/gradient-descent), a module for the sci-fi horror TTRPG Mothership. 

When I first read the module, I was a bit disappointed that there are no jumping-off points for what players may find when hacking into some of the terminals. I understand this is partially intentional, so that Keepers can improvise and decide what is best for the situation, but it still bugged me. Later, I got the idea of emulating certain terminals by letting my players navigate a directory on my Linux laptop through the terminal. I paired that with the [cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term) terminal, for some extra visual flavor (also available on [windows](https://gist.github.com/h3r/2d5dcb2f64cf34b6f7fdad85c57c1a45) over wsl). Depending on how comfortable your table is with working in the command line, you should tell them the important commands for navigation (cd <dir-name>, cd .., ls/dir) and for displaying text files (cat/type).

I will be adding more terminals, logs, and chat entries as time goes on, according to the progress my group makes with the module. Please feel free to contribute your own terminals, logs, users, chats, etc.

# Content Overview
## Reception Terminal (22B)
If the players successfully manage to hack/jury-rig the terminal, they can only manage to recover the files of a single user. The brief story of Emma Raine's (Empl.ID 01793860) chat logs and emails gives the players an overview of Monarch's takeover (inefficient shift scheduling for human workers in order to plead for more automation in front of shareholders, introduction of synth workers, introduction of brainscans).

> Wardens Notes:
>
> Depending on the tone you want to go with, you can in-/exclude the silly-colleagues directory. It contains some adapted logs from the game Hacknet, which made me chuckle.
>
> The mail directory contains a secret message from the underground union. If you want, you can let your players manually import the public key via gpg and let them decrypt the message on their own (disguised as solitaire-tournament.gpg), or you can skip this and use the clear text version (union\_newsletter\_23.mail).
>
> You can adjust what files the players can access, depending on how much or what kind of Information you want to give them. This could also be bound to the result of their jury-rig check (critical reveals all files; the higher the results while still succeeding -> more files).

## Logs
The maintenance logs also shed a bit of light on the transition the Bell made, leading up to the final\_warning after the complete takeover of Monarch. Feel free to distribute them wherever you deem appropriate.
