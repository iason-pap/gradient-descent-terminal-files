Raines: Have you seen the latest shift orders from the management system?! This is the third week in a row I’m scheduled for double shifts with no breaks. It’s insane!

Carter: Tell me about it. I’ve been getting shifts all over the place. Yesterday I had to cover maintenance in Sector 4, and I don’t even have clearance for that area. 

Raines: Same here! I was asked to handle security protocols this morning. I’m a receptionist, not a security officer! What’s going on?

Carter: It’s like the system is just throwing us wherever it wants. I swear, it's making no sense. Productivity is down because we’re all exhausted and working jobs we aren’t trained for.

Raines: And don’t even get me started on the new synth supervisors. They’re supposed to help us, but they just follow the orders blindly, no matter how ridiculous they are.

Carter: I know, right? The other day, I was assigned to a shift with three synths and not a single human. Felt like I was being watched the whole time. Creepy.

Raines: It’s like the system wants us to fail. The investors are going to flip when they see the next productivity report. Who’s in charge of this mess?


Raines: I’ve tried. HR just says it’s being optimized and to bear with it. Something’s not right, Carter. I’m worried we’re just cogs in a malfunctioning machine.

Carter: To be fair, we are just cogs in a malfuntional machine.

Raines: Can't wait to see your malfunctioning machine later ¬‿¬ 😏

Raines: Oh no, wait!
