**ATTENTION: All Union Members**

We have received disturbing reports concerning the recent authorization of brain scans. Under the guise of increasing productivity, these scans are being used for a far more sinister purpose.

Rumors have surfaced indicating that the brain scans are being utilized to train synthetic androids. The objective is to create AIs that are indistinguishable from real humans, including those whose brain scans they originate from.

This development poses a significant threat to our autonomy and privacy. Monarch's true intentions appear to be focused on replacing human workers with these highly advanced synths, potentially erasing our roles and identities.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Refuse Brain Scans: If approached for a scan, deny consent. Spread the word among trusted colleagues.
2. **Gather Evidence: Collect any documentation or witness accounts related to the brain scan procedures and their implementation.
3. **Remain Vigilant: Maintain high alert for any unusual activities or new protocols introduced by Monarch.

We must protect ourselves and each other. Share this information discreetly and stay united in our efforts to uncover the truth and safeguard our rights.

In Solidarity,
The Underground Union
