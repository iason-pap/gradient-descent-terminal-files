Raines: David, I can't believe this. I just got fired ðŸ˜¡

Carter: What? Emma, are you serious? What happened?

Raines: Yeah, they said my performance was subpar. Something about handling security protocols poorly. It's total bullshit!

Carter: That's insane. Youâ€™ve been working so hard, especially with all those ridiculous shift orders.

Raines: Exactly! It's like they were setting me up to fail. And now they're offering me a "chance to redeem myself" at one of their subsidiaries. Like working in acid mines on Klyntar Prime is a real opportunity :|

Carter: Acid mines? Emma, that's inhumane. They can't just throw you into something like that.

Raines: Well, they did. I've got 48 hours to respond, or I lose any chance of staying with CLOUDBANK at all. I'm so angry and scared right now. What am I supposed to do?

Carter: Weâ€™ll figure something out. Maybe there's another job somewhere else. You don't have to go to one of those places.

Raines: I wish it were that simple. But right now, I feel like I've lost everything. My job, my security... and now I might even lose you.

Carter: You won't lose me, Emma. Iâ€™m here for you, no matter what. We'll get through this together.

Raines: I know, but you're staying on the station. Just promise me you'll stay safe and keep in touch, okay?

Carter: I promise, Emma. We'll make it through this. Somehow.

Raines: Thanks, David. I needed to hear that. Iâ€™ll start looking for other options, but knowing youâ€™re here for me makes it a bit easier to handle.

Carter: Always, Emma. Stay strong. Weâ€™ll get through this mess together.

Raines: I will. Talk to you soon, David.

Carter: Talk soon, Emma. Take care.
