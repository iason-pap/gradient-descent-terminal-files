Raines: David, have you heard about the new brain scan policy? Corporate just announced that Monarch is allowed to scan our brains to "increase productivity."

Carter: Yeah, I heard. It sounds really invasive. How is scanning our brains supposed to help productivity?

Raines: They say it’s to better understand our work patterns and improve efficiency. But it feels wrong. Like they're digging into our minds without our consent.

Carter: I don’t trust it. Monarch is already too involved in everything. What if they’re using this data for something else?

Raines: Exactly. I can't shake the feeling that there’s more to this than they’re telling us. I heard some of the guys in maintenance talking about it too. They’re worried.

Carter: We should be worried. This doesn’t sit right with me at all. We need to be careful, Emma. If they’re collecting brain scans, who knows what else they’re planning.

Raines: I know. We need to keep an eye on this. And stay in touch with the others. Maybe someone has more information.

Carter: Agreed. Let’s talk to the team discreetly and see what we can find out. Stay safe, Emma.

Raines: You too, David. Hey, do you have any plans for the evening? 

Carter: Not really, why?

Raines: Would you like to meet up in the canteen later? We could use a break from all this stress.

Carter: That sounds perfect. How about 1900 hours?

Raines: 1900 it is. I’ll see you then :)
